The homepage also seems like a fake ecommerce site and makes users question the authenticity of the website.","description1":"The website is functional, but lacks intuitive design, subjective satisfaction, efficiency, accessibility and lacks responsiveness.","description2":"As a first step I sketched out my redesign thoughts into prototypes and then went on the fixing on a visual style guide. <b>This process helped me stay in line with the process of coding out the HTML/CSS and prevented me from fluctuating between design ideas.</b>"},"Deployed":{"title":"3 Deployed Homepage","description":"As a final step, to demonstrate that the high-fidelity mockup was possible to implement, I developed my own version of my final homepage of website which can be found <b><a style=\\"color:#0D7369\\" target=\\"blank\\" href=\\"https://frozen-basin-88210.herokuapp.com/\\">at this link</a></b>."},"Conclusion":{"title":"4 Conclusion","description":"This project forced me to consider how an interface can maximize each of the 3 aspects of usability. I often took the clean, informative webpages I usually frequent for granted, without realizing how much thought and time were invested before it was deployed. After very intentionally focusing on those concepts when designing and implementing this redesign, I\'ve learned a lot about how a page with a clear visual hierarchy and informational message influences what the user takes away from it.","description1":"This was also the first time I used a screen-reader simulation to evaluate the accessibility of a webpage. I have a renewed appreciation for developers/designers who incorporate accessibility considerations into everything they build, and for those who use screen-readers to interact with the web. Neither are easy tasks!"}}},"repohub":{"title":"Repohub","parts":{"Overview":{"title":"1 Overview","description":"There are many great repositories available on <b>GitHub</b>, an online platform for open-source code.

The main part of the website is the good search platform, which lets you have an interactive experience with exploring the behavioral tasks at Brown labs. We spent most time on deciding the way to efficiently display the task information to the website users. After careful thoughts, we went ahead with the table view and a sidebar to have the search and filter options. As the number of the tasks in the registry could increase over time as people register, we thought a table is the best view to showcase multiple items."},"Conclusion":{"title":"3 Conclusion","description":"This project forced me to learn a lot about how I can create JavaScript actions for Github and automate mundane tasks like converting issues into XML files.

Don’t assume anything - the issues user testing reveals are really just assumptions we made about user knowledge.</li><li>Planning interactions ahead of time using wireframes makes high-fi prototyping much simpler, especially when you end up having 65 frames.</li><li>Take advantage of brain power through team members! This was our first group project and although it was a bit chaotic at times, having a sounding board and combining ideas leads to a better overall product.</li></ul>"}}}}}')},"740a":function(e,t,o){},"85ec":function(e,t,o){},add0:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o("0ea6")}});
