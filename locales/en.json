I often took the clean, informative webpages I usually frequent for granted, without realizing how much thought and time were invested before it was deployed. After very intentionally focusing on those concepts when designing and implementing this redesign, I've learned a lot about how a page with a clear visual hierarchy and informational message influences what the user takes away from it.",

I have a renewed appreciation for developers/designers who incorporate accessibility considerations into everything they build, and for those who use screen-readers to interact with the web. Neither are easy tasks!"

Our key takeaways were:</p><ul><li>During user testing, it became clear to us that users could benefit from “first time’ instructions about how to navigate in the app. In the future, we would add pop ups for each button and include instructions about how the app works (with the option to “not view again”).</li><li>Similarly, try to think as much as possible from the point of view of the User! Don’t assume anything - the issues user testing reveals are really just assumptions we made about user knowledge.</li><li>Planning interactions ahead of time using wireframes makes high-fi prototyping much simpler, especially when you end up having 65 frames.</li><li>Take advantage of brain power through team members! This was our first group project and although it was a bit chaotic at times, having a sounding board and combining ideas leads to a better overall product.</li></ul>"
